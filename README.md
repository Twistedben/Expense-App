# Mobile Expense App

A Mobile App written in Dart and Flutter that keeps track of weekly expenses and illustrates the percentage spent each day in a week on a bar graph.

## Tech-Stack

We make use of Flutter, Dart, Material Design, Cupertino, and Iintl.dart for date formatting.
Responsive and adavptive design. Works well in landscape and portrait and follows Cupertino on iOS and Material on Android. Responds and resizes well on many different devices. 

## Usage

New expenses can be added with amount, title, and using a datepicker, the day in which is was bought. The expenses will be calculated on the chart bar to occupy the space of the bar to reflect how much of the weekly's expense was used in one day in comparison to the rest of the week.
